**Communication System with OSPF Routing Protocol**
This repository contains a project that demonstrates a scenario of a communication system using the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) routing protocol. The project focuses on establishing communication between two standalone systems by utilizing the OSPF protocol and configuring three routes. The simulation is performed using Cisco Packet Tracer software and involves routers such as Cisco 1841, generic routers, and generic PCs.

**Project Overview**
The communication system project utilizes the OSPF routing protocol to determine the shortest path between the source and destination routers. OSPF, which stands for Open Shortest Path First, is a link-state routing protocol developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). It falls under the category of Interior Gateway Protocols (IGP) and aims to efficiently route packets within a large autonomous system or routing domain.
The project demonstrates how OSPF selects the best path using its Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm. By configuring the routers and establishing OSPF communication, the two standalone systems can exchange data using the shortest path.

**Software and Hardware**
The project employs the following software and hardware components:
**Cisco Packet Tracer:** Cisco Packet Tracer is used as the simulation software to design, configure, and test the communication system. It provides a virtual environment for network modeling and enables the simulation of network devices.
**Routers:** The project utilizes routers such as Cisco 1841, generic routers, and generic PCs to simulate the network infrastructure and enable the OSPF routing protocol.

**Repository Structure**
The repository is structured as follows:
/CLI commands: This directory contains the CLI commands which were used for configuring the routers with IP addresses and the PCS with their gateways and ip addresses, the                    routers were also configured with the OSPF.
/project report: This directory includes additional documentation related to the project, such as circuit diagrams, and explanations of OSPF concepts.
/presentation: This directory contains presentaton pertaining to the project.

**Getting Started**
To explore and run the communication system project, follow these steps:
1. Install Cisco Packet Tracer on your computer or ensure you have access to the software.
2. Import the network design files from the /project report directory into Cisco Packet Tracer.
3. Review the provided documentation in the /project report directory to understand the project's setup, configuration, and OSPF routing principles.
4. Simulate the network in Cisco Packet Tracer and verify the communication between the two standalone systems.
5. Customize and modify the network design, configurations, or OSPF parameters as desired to further explore the capabilities of the OSPF routing protocol.

Enjoy exploring the capabilities of the communication system and the OSPF routing protocol in establishing efficient data communication!
